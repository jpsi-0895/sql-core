**Exceptional SQL skills** encompass a deep understanding of **SQL syntax**, **database design principles**, and **advanced query techniques**. Here are key areas and examples that demonstrate **exceptional SQL skills**:

### 1. **Advanced Query Writing**:
   - **Complex Joins**: Ability to work with multiple tables using different types of joins (INNER JOIN, LEFT JOIN, RIGHT JOIN, FULL OUTER JOIN, etc.).
   
     ```sql
     SELECT u.name, o.order_id, o.order_date
     FROM users u
     LEFT JOIN orders o ON u.id = o.user_id;
     ```

   - **Subqueries**: Subqueries (also known as nested queries) can be used within the `SELECT`, `WHERE`, or `FROM` clauses for more dynamic querying.

     ```sql
     SELECT name
     FROM employees
     WHERE salary > (SELECT AVG(salary) FROM employees);
     ```

   - **Common Table Expressions (CTEs)**: Using CTEs to break complex queries into manageable parts, improving readability and maintainability.

     ```sql
     WITH sales_cte AS (
         SELECT product_id, SUM(amount) AS total_sales
         FROM sales
         GROUP BY product_id
     )
     SELECT p.product_name, s.total_sales
     FROM products p
     JOIN sales_cte s ON p.product_id = s.product_id;
     ```

   - **Window Functions**: Proficiency in using window functions (`ROW_NUMBER()`, `RANK()`, `DENSE_RANK()`, `LEAD()`, `LAG()`) for ranking, running totals, and partitioned analytics.

     ```sql
     SELECT employee_id, salary,
            RANK() OVER (ORDER BY salary DESC) AS rank
     FROM employees;
     ```

   - **Recursive Queries**: Ability to write recursive queries to handle hierarchical data, like organizational structures or bill-of-materials trees.

     ```sql
     WITH RECURSIVE org_chart AS (
         SELECT employee_id, manager_id, name
         FROM employees
         WHERE manager_id IS NULL
         UNION ALL
         SELECT e.employee_id, e.manager_id, e.name
         FROM employees e
         JOIN org_chart o ON e.manager_id = o.employee_id
     )
     SELECT * FROM org_chart;
     ```

### 2. **Database Design and Optimization**:
   - **Normalization and Denormalization**: Expert understanding of database normalization forms (1NF, 2NF, 3NF, etc.) and when to use denormalization for performance optimization.
   - **Indexes**: Knowledge of creating and optimizing indexes to speed up query performance.
     ```sql
     CREATE INDEX idx_user_email ON users (email);
     ```
   - **Partitioning and Sharding**: For large datasets, creating partitioned tables or sharding strategies to distribute data across multiple databases.
   - **Database Constraints**: Understanding and using constraints like `PRIMARY KEY`, `FOREIGN KEY`, `UNIQUE`, `CHECK`, and `NOT NULL` to maintain data integrity.

     ```sql
     CREATE TABLE employees (
         employee_id INT PRIMARY KEY,
         name VARCHAR(100),
         salary DECIMAL(10, 2),
         department_id INT,
         CONSTRAINT fk_department FOREIGN KEY (department_id) REFERENCES departments(department_id)
     );
     ```

### 3. **Performance Tuning**:
   - **Query Optimization**: Using tools like `EXPLAIN PLAN` to analyze and optimize SQL queries.
   - **Optimizing Joins**: Understanding which joins are most efficient in different scenarios and avoiding performance pitfalls (e.g., Cartesian joins).
   - **Avoiding N+1 Query Problems**: Writing queries to minimize the number of database round trips and loading data efficiently.

   ```sql
   EXPLAIN SELECT u.name, p.product_name
   FROM users u
   JOIN products p ON u.id = p.user_id;
   ```

### 4. **Advanced SQL Features**:
   - **Triggers**: Using triggers to automatically execute actions when certain events occur in the database (e.g., inserting a new record or updating existing ones).
   
     ```sql
     CREATE TRIGGER update_inventory AFTER INSERT ON sales
     FOR EACH ROW
     UPDATE products SET stock_quantity = stock_quantity - NEW.quantity
     WHERE product_id = NEW.product_id;
     ```

   - **Stored Procedures and Functions**: Writing reusable stored procedures and functions to encapsulate complex logic and improve maintainability.
   
     ```sql
     CREATE PROCEDURE GetUserOrders(IN user_id INT)
     BEGIN
         SELECT * FROM orders WHERE user_id = user_id;
     END;
     ```

   - **Transactions**: Expertise in using transactions to ensure data consistency when performing multiple operations.
   
     ```sql
     BEGIN TRANSACTION;
     UPDATE accounts SET balance = balance - 100 WHERE account_id = 1;
     UPDATE accounts SET balance = balance + 100 WHERE account_id = 2;
     COMMIT;
     ```

### 5. **Data Manipulation and Aggregation**:
   - **Group By and Aggregations**: Mastering aggregate functions like `COUNT()`, `SUM()`, `AVG()`, `MIN()`, and `MAX()` along with grouping data.
   
     ```sql
     SELECT department_id, AVG(salary)
     FROM employees
     GROUP BY department_id;
     ```

   - **HAVING Clause**: Filtering grouped data after aggregation using `HAVING`.
   
     ```sql
     SELECT department_id, SUM(salary)
     FROM employees
     GROUP BY department_id
     HAVING SUM(salary) > 50000;
     ```

   - **Advanced Filtering**: Using `CASE` statements for conditional logic or complex filtering.

     ```sql
     SELECT name,
            CASE
                WHEN salary > 100000 THEN 'High'
                WHEN salary BETWEEN 50000 AND 100000 THEN 'Medium'
                ELSE 'Low'
            END AS salary_level
     FROM employees;
     ```

### 6. **Data Security and Management**:
   - **SQL Injection Prevention**: Implementing secure SQL practices, such as using prepared statements and avoiding dynamic SQL.
   
     ```php
     $stmt = $pdo->prepare("SELECT * FROM users WHERE email = :email");
     $stmt->execute(['email' => $email]);
     ```

   - **Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)**: Setting up database users with specific roles and permissions to ensure security and proper access management.
   
     ```sql
     CREATE USER 'admin'@'localhost' IDENTIFIED BY 'password';
     GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON database.* TO 'admin'@'localhost';
     ```

### 7. **Backup and Recovery**:
   - **Backup Strategies**: Writing SQL scripts or using tools to schedule and automate backups.
   - **Data Recovery**: Using SQL commands to restore data from backups or recover data in case of failure.

### 8. **Database Reporting**:
   - **Complex Reporting**: Creating complex reports with multiple joins, subqueries, and aggregation to analyze business metrics.
   
     ```sql
     SELECT department_name, COUNT(employee_id) AS employee_count
     FROM departments d
     LEFT JOIN employees e ON e.department_id = d.department_id
     GROUP BY department_name;
     ```
