**Exceptional SQL Query Skills** involve writing efficient, optimized, and well-structured SQL queries to retrieve and manipulate data effectively. Below are some advanced and exceptional techniques that go beyond basic `SELECT` queries, demonstrating higher proficiency in SQL.

### 1. **Efficient Use of Joins**
Joins are fundamental for combining data from multiple tables. Knowing when and how to use the different types of joins is essential:

- **Inner Join**: Retrieves rows that have matching values in both tables.
- **Left Join (or Left Outer Join)**: Retrieves all rows from the left table and matching rows from the right table.
- **Right Join (or Right Outer Join)**: Retrieves all rows from the right table and matching rows from the left table.
- **Full Outer Join**: Retrieves all rows when there is a match in either left or right table.
  
#### Example:
```sql
SELECT e.name, d.department_name
FROM employees e
JOIN departments d ON e.department_id = d.department_id;
```

- **Avoiding Cartesian Joins**: Cartesian joins can result in a massive number of rows and poor performance. Always make sure your `JOIN` conditions are properly specified to avoid it.

### 2. **Subqueries (Nested Queries)**
Subqueries allow you to nest one query inside another, and they can be used in the `SELECT`, `FROM`, or `WHERE` clauses to add flexibility to your queries.

- **Subquery in the `SELECT` Clause**: This is useful for returning a calculated value or aggregate that requires filtering or further analysis.

#### Example:
```sql
SELECT name,
       (SELECT MAX(salary) FROM employees) AS max_salary
FROM employees;
```

- **Correlated Subqueries**: In correlated subqueries, the inner query references the outer query, making it more powerful.

#### Example:
```sql
SELECT e.name, e.salary
FROM employees e
WHERE e.salary > (SELECT AVG(salary) FROM employees);
```

### 3. **Window Functions (Analytic Functions)**
Window functions enable you to perform calculations across a set of table rows related to the current row. These functions do not collapse rows, unlike aggregate functions. They include `ROW_NUMBER()`, `RANK()`, `DENSE_RANK()`, `LEAD()`, `LAG()`, and others.

- **Using `ROW_NUMBER()` to rank data**: 
#### Example:
```sql
SELECT name, salary, 
       ROW_NUMBER() OVER (ORDER BY salary DESC) AS rank
FROM employees;
```

- **Using `LEAD()` and `LAG()` to compare rows in a result set**:
#### Example:
```sql
SELECT name, salary, 
       LAG(salary, 1) OVER (ORDER BY salary DESC) AS prev_salary
FROM employees;
```

### 4. **Common Table Expressions (CTEs)**
CTEs improve the readability and structure of complex queries by breaking them into reusable parts. They are often used for recursive queries or when you need to refer to the same query multiple times.

#### Example:
```sql
WITH dept_sales AS (
    SELECT department_id, SUM(salary) AS total_salary
    FROM employees
    GROUP BY department_id
)
SELECT d.department_name, s.total_salary
FROM departments d
JOIN dept_sales s ON d.department_id = s.department_id;
```

- **Recursive CTEs**: These allow for querying hierarchical data, such as organizational charts or product categories.

#### Example:
```sql
WITH RECURSIVE org_chart AS (
    SELECT employee_id, manager_id, name
    FROM employees
    WHERE manager_id IS NULL
    UNION ALL
    SELECT e.employee_id, e.manager_id, e.name
    FROM employees e
    JOIN org_chart o ON e.manager_id = o.employee_id
)
SELECT * FROM org_chart;
```

### 5. **Optimizing Aggregate Functions**
Using aggregate functions like `SUM()`, `COUNT()`, `AVG()`, `MIN()`, and `MAX()` effectively is critical for summarizing data.

- **Group By Optimization**: Grouping data efficiently reduces unnecessary processing.
  
#### Example:
```sql
SELECT department_id, COUNT(employee_id) AS employee_count
FROM employees
GROUP BY department_id;
```

- **Having Clause**: Use `HAVING` to filter grouped data after aggregation, not in the `WHERE` clause.

#### Example:
```sql
SELECT department_id, AVG(salary)
FROM employees
GROUP BY department_id
HAVING AVG(salary) > 50000;
```

### 6. **Advanced Filtering with `CASE` Statements**
You can create conditional logic in your queries using the `CASE` statement. This allows you to categorize or modify the results dynamically.

#### Example:
```sql
SELECT name,
       CASE
           WHEN salary > 100000 THEN 'High'
           WHEN salary BETWEEN 50000 AND 100000 THEN 'Medium'
           ELSE 'Low'
       END AS salary_range
FROM employees;
```

### 7. **Handling NULL Values**
Handling `NULL` values properly is essential in SQL. The most common approaches are `IS NULL`, `IS NOT NULL`, and the `COALESCE()` function.

- **Using `COALESCE()`**: This function returns the first non-`NULL` value in a list of arguments.

#### Example:
```sql
SELECT name, COALESCE(phone_number, 'N/A') AS phone
FROM employees;
```

- **Using `IFNULL()`**: This is similar to `COALESCE()` but only for two arguments.

#### Example:
```sql
SELECT name, IFNULL(email, 'No email') AS email
FROM employees;
```

### 8. **Using `GROUP_CONCAT()` for String Aggregation**
In MySQL, `GROUP_CONCAT()` is used to concatenate values from multiple rows into a single string. This is useful for listing multiple values that would otherwise appear as multiple rows.

#### Example:
```sql
SELECT department_id, GROUP_CONCAT(employee_name ORDER BY employee_name) AS employee_list
FROM employees
GROUP BY department_id;
```

### 9. **Performance Optimization Techniques**
- **Indexes**: Use appropriate indexing to speed up queries. Typically, create indexes on columns that are frequently used in `WHERE`, `JOIN`, and `ORDER BY` clauses.
  
- **Avoid `SELECT *`**: Always specify the columns you need rather than selecting all columns (`*`), which reduces unnecessary data retrieval.
  
#### Example:
```sql
SELECT name, salary FROM employees WHERE department_id = 1;
```

- **Use of `EXPLAIN PLAN`**: Analyzing the execution plan helps identify potential bottlenecks in complex queries.
  
#### Example:
```sql
EXPLAIN SELECT name, salary FROM employees WHERE department_id = 1;
```

### 10. **Set Operations (`UNION`, `INTERSECT`, `EXCEPT`)**
Set operations allow you to combine or subtract the results of two queries. These operations can be powerful for complex data retrieval needs.

- **`UNION`**: Combines the results of two queries and removes duplicates.
- **`UNION ALL`**: Combines the results of two queries and keeps duplicates.
- **`INTERSECT`**: Returns only the rows that appear in both queries.
- **`EXCEPT` (or `MINUS`)**: Returns the rows from the first query that do not appear in the second query.

#### Example:
```sql
SELECT name FROM employees WHERE department_id = 1
UNION
SELECT name FROM employees WHERE department_id = 2;
```

### 11. **Handling JSON Data** (MySQL 5.7+ / PostgreSQL)
When dealing with JSON data, MySQL and PostgreSQL offer powerful functions to extract and manipulate JSON data.

#### Example:
```sql
SELECT JSON_EXTRACT(data, '$.employee_name') AS employee_name
FROM employee_data
WHERE JSON_EXTRACT(data, '$.employee_id') = 1001;
```

### 12. **Transactions in Queries**
Using transactions ensures that multiple SQL operations are executed together, providing consistency and handling potential errors effectively. Transactions can be used for complex operations where multiple `INSERT`, `UPDATE`, or `DELETE` operations need to be executed together.

#### Example:
```sql
BEGIN TRANSACTION;

UPDATE accounts SET balance = balance - 100 WHERE account_id = 1;
UPDATE accounts SET balance = balance + 100 WHERE account_id = 2;

COMMIT;
```
