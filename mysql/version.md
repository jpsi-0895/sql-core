To check the version of MySQL you are using, you can execute the following command:

```sql
SELECT VERSION();
```

Alternatively, you can use the MySQL command line interface or terminal by running the following command:

```bash
mysql --version
```

Or:

```bash
mysql -V
```

These commands will display the MySQL version in the following format:

```
mysql  Ver 8.0.27 for Linux on x86_64 (MySQL Community Server - GPL)
```

This will show you the version and other related details.
